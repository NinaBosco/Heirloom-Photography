My friend stages wild photoshoots for her daughter and the pictures always come out wonderfully. I've been telling her for years that she should start a business. When tasked with creating a site for an imaginary business, I decided to make a template for her should she decide to move forward. I did not use any of her actual pictures to respect her privacy.
